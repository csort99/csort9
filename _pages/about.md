I am a Ph.D. course student at Graduate School of EIS, Yokohama National University (YNU), advised by Prof. Junji Shikata. 
I also belong to CPSEC, Advanced Cryptography Research Team, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) as a technical trainee.
I received my Bachelor's degree in Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Numazu College in 2022 and I received my Master's degree in Informatics from Yokohama National University in 2024.

I am interested in the mathematical aspects of cybersecurity, particularly around cryptography. My current research focuses on cryptography with advanced functionality (e.g. identity-based encryption, matchmaking encryption, proxy re-signature).
