I am a master's course student at Yokohama National University (YNU), advised by Prof. Junji Shikata. 
I received my Bachelor's degree in Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Numazu College in 2022.

I am interested in mathematical aspects of cybersecurity, particularly around cryptography. My current research focuses are applied cryptography (particularly, identity-based encryption, matchmaking encryption, proxy re-signature).
